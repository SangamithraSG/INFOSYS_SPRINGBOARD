Infosys Springboard Virtual Internship 6.0 Batch 11 Project Code:#M-11-3

#Project Title
AI-Enabled Recommendation Engine for an E-commerce Platform

#Description
This repository contains milestone-wise implementation of an AI-enabled recommendation engine developed as part of my learning through Infosys Springboard Virtual Internship.

#Dataset
- RetailRocket E-commerce Dataset
- File used: events.csv

#Milestones
- Milestone 1: Data Preparation
-Milestone 2: Model Building
    - Implemented an Item–Item Collaborative Filtering recommendation model  
    - Trained the model from scratch using cosine similarity on user–item interaction data  
    - Generated product recommendations based on learned similarity patterns  
    - Performed initial model tuning by varying top-N recommendations
(more milestones will be added once completed)
Each milestone is implemented in a separate folder.

-Milestone 3: Evaluation and Refinement

## Objective
Evaluate the trained recommendation model and refine it for better performance.

## Work Done
- Evaluated the collaborative filtering model using Precision, Recall, and F1-score
- Used interaction-based relevance for offline evaluation
- Refined the model by tuning Top-K recommendations
- Compared performance for Top-5 and Top-10 recommendations

## Outcome
The evaluation demonstrates that increasing the number of recommendations improves recall, validating the effectiveness of the recommendation model.
